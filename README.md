# nLuaCAS - Symbolic Calculus Engine for TI-Nspire CX

**nLuaCAS** is a lightweight, high-performance symbolic math engine built entirely in Lua for the TI-Nspire CX and CX II calculators. It provides a rich set of calculus and algebra tools in a user-friendly, calculator-native UI.

üöß This is a work-in-progress (WIP) project and may continue to evolve with features, refinements, and bug fixes.  
‚úÖ Despite its lightweight design, **nLuaCAS qualifies as a functional Computer Algebra System (CAS)** ‚Äî it performs symbolic manipulation including differentiation, integration, simplification, and solving, all on-device.

‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is for educational use only. It is not intended for exams or assessments unless explicitly permitted. Misuse may violate academic integrity policies.
